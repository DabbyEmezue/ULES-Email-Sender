# ULES-Email-Sender

This is an email sender with an authentication service for the University of Lagos Engineering Society. I built this from scratch with a short product completion deadline. The app has two end points:
1. sendMails for sending mail invites to attendees
2. checkMails to verify attendeee codes sent with the mails.
